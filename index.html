                <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">AI Development and Frameworks</h2><p class='mt-6'>You don’t need agent libraries to solve complex business problems. Agentless is a non-agent framework adopted by @OpenAI to achieve the highest accuracy on the SWE Bench with o3. SWE-bench is a benchmark of real-world software engineering problems from @github. Agentless follows.</p><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GhFm8j7WEAABjR-.jpg" alt="" class="w-full rounded-lg mb-4 mt-6"><p class='mt-6'>Did you know @MSFTResearch's phi-4 can be adapted to the @AIatMeta Llama architecture? That is possible by separating the QKV and gate/up layers, allowing more accurate LoRA fine-tuning. This means all of your Llama-built tooling can be used with phi-4.</p><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GhBb0U6XsAErugv.jpg" alt="" class="w-full rounded-lg mb-4 mt-6"><p class='mt-6'>Getting a lot of questions about where to learn how to build with AI. I got tired of pointing to outdated resources. This is why I built the AI Academy. Here is my recommended learning path: 1) Introduction to Prompt Engineering: Learn the best practices for prompting LLMs.</p><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GhBmf0uXYAAfLHq.jpg" alt="" class="w-full rounded-lg mb-4 mt-6"><p class='mt-6'>There is a lot of unique content and examples you won't see anywhere else. I think it's a lot better to learn by building projects than from theory or books. Don’t get me wrong, I love books but you have to try building things to learn.</p></section><section class="bg-white shadow-md rounded-lg p-6">

I pasted those into veo 2 verbatim & overlayed the poem (I also asked for one more scene revealing the Lady, again using the verbatim prompt).</p><video controls class="w-full rounded-lg mb-4 mt-6">

But for the most part, it makes people do whatever they can for amusement, including acting sadistically.</p><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GhEb5PHWkAAHPnh.jpg" alt="" class="w-full rounded-lg mb-4 mt-6"><p class='mt-6'>If you come to like a particular AI model, you want to use it everywhere & as people get used to multimodal agentic models with long memory they can talk to, it will make them want to use "their" AI alone. In this world, are phones just hardware & the model what you care about?</p></section><section class="bg-white shadow-md rounded-lg p-6">
