                <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">AI Frameworks and Models</h2><p class='mt-6'>You don’t need agent libraries to solve complex business problems. Agentless is a non-agent framework adopted by @OpenAI to achieve the highest accuracy on the SWE Bench with o3. SWE-bench is a benchmark of real-world software engineering problems from @github. Agentless follows.</p><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GhFm8j7WEAABjR-.jpg" alt="" class="w-full rounded-lg mb-4 mt-6"><p class='mt-6'>Did you know @MSFTResearch's phi-4 can be adapted to the @AIatMeta Llama architecture? That is possible by separating the QKV and gate/up layers, allowing more accurate LoRA fine-tuning. This means all of your Llama-built tooling can be used with phi-4.</p><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GhBb0U6XsAErugv.jpg" alt="" class="w-full rounded-lg mb-4 mt-6"><p class='mt-6'>Sky-T1-32B-Preview, open source O1 like model trained for < 450$, achieves competitive reasoning and coding performance (e.g., 82.4 on Math500, 86.3 on LiveCode-East) compared to QwQ (85.4, 90.7) and o1-preview (81.4, 92.9).

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Learning and Resources</h2><p class='mt-6'>Getting a lot of questions about where to learn how to build with AI. I got tired of pointing to outdated resources. This is why I built the AI Academy. Here is my recommended learning path: 1) Introduction to Prompt Engineering: Learn the best practices for prompting LLMs.</p><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GhBmf0uXYAAfLHq.jpg" alt="" class="w-full rounded-lg mb-4 mt-6"><p class='mt-6'>There is a lot of unique content and examples you won't see anywhere else. I think it's a lot better to learn by building projects than from theory or books. Don’t get me wrong, I love books but you have to try building things to learn.</p></section><section class="bg-white shadow-md rounded-lg p-6">
                <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">AI Models and Performance</h2><p class='mt-6'>This is such lazy 'journalism' - copy pasting publicly available data curated by EAs for public reference, and adding absolute zero value than calling it evil every 6 months. I was literally there when an EA was commissioned to make this map by another EA. Do your own damn work.</p><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GhF38cNboAAn5Mt.png" alt="" class="w-full rounded-lg mb-4 mt-6"><p class='mt-6'>17000 datapoints and a CRACKED (Qwen) base model is between you and o1 at home.
